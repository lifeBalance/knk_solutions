# Chapter 16: Projects

## Project 1
Write a program that asks the user to enter an international dialing code and then looks it up in the `country_codes` array (see Section 16.3). If it finds the code, the program should display the name of the corresponding country; if not, the program should print an error message.

**Answer**: Check `pr01.c`.

## Project 2
Modify the `inventory.c` program of Section 16.3 so that the `p` (print) operation displays the parts sorted by part number.

**Answer**: Check the `pr02` folder.

## Project 3
Modify the `inventory.c` program of Section 16.3 by making `inventory` and `num_parts` local to the `main` function.

**Answer**: Check the `pr03` folder.
