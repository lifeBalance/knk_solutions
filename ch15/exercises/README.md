source files.

(a) Describe several other advantages.  
(b) Describe some disadvantages.

**Answer**:

(a) Some **advantages** of multi-file programs are:

* The structure of the program is easier to understand just by looking at the files, since every file contains group of related functions and variables.
* It saves development time, since we only have to compile those source files that are modified during the process.
* If facilitates code reuse, since we could drop source files in other projects.

(b) Main **disadvantage** is added complexity, especially if the number of files grows disproportionately.
